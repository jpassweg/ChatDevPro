Solve a negotiation between these parties:


1. Government Agencies

    Current Needs: Adaptation to rapidly changing climates, effective implementation of international agreements (e.g., Paris Agreement), and the integration of new technologies for better environmental monitoring and enforcement.
    Current Goals: Strengthening resilience to climate change, achieving net-zero emissions targets, and fostering international cooperation to tackle global environmental challenges.
    Current Beliefs: There's a growing recognition of the urgency to act on climate change and environmental degradation, with an emphasis on science-based policy decisions and the need for global action.

2. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)

    Current Needs: Increased need for collaboration with a broader range of stakeholders, including businesses and governments, to effectively address global environmental issues. They also face a need for leveraging social media and technology to mobilize public opinion and support.
    Current Goals: Pushing for ambitious climate actions, conservation of rapidly dwindling biodiversity, and promoting circular economies to reduce waste and pollution.
    Current Beliefs: Many NGOs now emphasize the interconnectedness of social, economic, and environmental justice, advocating for solutions that address these aspects holistically.
    
1. Fossil Fuel Industry

    Interests: Expanding exploration and extraction operations, maintaining or increasing current levels of fossil fuel consumption, and minimizing regulatory burdens related to environmental protection.
    Controversy: The fossil fuel industry is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. Efforts to expand fossil fuel operations clash with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources.

2. Logging and Forestry Companies

    Interests: Maximizing timber extraction for profit, converting forests into agricultural lands, and advocating for less restrictive environmental regulations.
    Controversy: Large-scale logging, especially in tropical rainforests, leads to habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, and contributes to climate change. Sustainable management practices are often at odds with short-term economic gains.
